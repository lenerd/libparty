# Submission for CRYPROT Programming Competition

by Lennart Braun

This random-OT implementation is based on the oblivious transfer protocol by
Hauck and Loss [HL17] (cf. Protocol OT*, Table 2 in their paper).  To get an
R-OT protocol, we omit the last steps of OT* such that the keys k_i are used as
outputs of the protocol.

The group and the random oracles are instantiated with Curve25519 and Blake2b,
respectively.  The implementation is written in C/C++ and uses the following
dependencies:
* Botan, BSD license
    * for Blake2b implementation
* Curve25519 implementation of BoringSSL (generated by fiat-crypto), MIT license
    * for elliptic curve arithmetic
* Boost, Boost license
    * Boost.Asio for network communication and threading
    * Boost.Program Options for handling of command line arguments
